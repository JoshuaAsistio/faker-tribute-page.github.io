            Faker was born in Seoul on May 7, 1996. He and his brother were
            raised by their grandparents and their father, Lee Kyung-joon, in
            Gangseo District, Seoul. Lee always loved puzzles and video games,
            often playing custom maps for Warcraft III and the MOBA Chaos during
            his teenage years. He discovered League of Legends in late 2011, and
            quickly became adept at the game. He attended Mapo High School, the
            same high school that Deft of DRX attended, but dropped out to join
            SKT T1 K and pursue a career in esports.
