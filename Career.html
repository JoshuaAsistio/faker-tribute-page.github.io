        <p>
          Lee was picked up by SK Telecom T1 K in 2013 as their starting mid
          laner. SKT T1 K dominated the Korean scene, and in October 2013, Lee
          led them to win their first League of Legends World Championship.
          Later in the HOT6iX Champions Summer 2013, Lee cemented his status as
          a brilliant player due to his perfect Zed outplay against KT Rolster
          Bullets mid laner Yoo "Ryu" Sang-wook, which would then become one of
          the most iconic moments in League of Legends history.

        <h2 class="top-margin center">2014</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, SK Telecom T1 K followed their success through in the OGN
          winter season, making the entire run without dropping a single game.
          They would then go on to win All-Star Paris 2014. However, their
          Winter season success did not follow through and during the Spring and
          Summer seasons, SKT T1 K failed to qualify for the 2014 World
          Championship. In the following offseason, Riot Games changed the team
          regulations so that each organizations may only have one team
          participating in each league. This led to the merger of SKT T1 K and
          SKT T1 S, and the subsequent departures of Impact and Piglet for the
          NA LCS. The new team would compete under the name SKT T1.

        <h2 class="top-margin center">2015</h2>
        <p>
          After the 2014 season, Lee reportedly declined an offer of over
          $1,000,000 by a Chinese team, preferring to stay in Korea on SKT. In
          November 2014 it was reported that Lee had declined contract offers
          from several Chinese companies including one offer of ₩500 million
          ($425,403 USD) for streaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout 2015, Lee shared the mid lane position with Lee "Easyhoon"
          Ji-hoon. Depending on the team composition SKT wanted to play, either
          one of the players could be substituted into the game. Lee had many
          notable performances in the LCK such as a pentakill against NaJin
          e-mFire with his LeBlanc. SKT ended the summer split in first place
          and advanced to the world championship.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the 2015 World Championship, Lee and his team won while only
          dropping one game in the finals for a record of 15–1 throughout the
          tournament.

        <h2 class="top-margin center">2016</h2>
        <p>
          Lee and his team started off the 2016 Season by winning the LCK Spring
          Split. With this victory, SKT was guaranteed a spot in the 2016
          Mid-Season Invitational. At that point in time, MSI was the only major
          international tournament they had yet to win. They were heavily
          favored coming into the tournament, but were initially unable to
          perform up to their usual standards, unexpectedly losing several games
          in the group stage. However, they managed to turn things around during
          the elimination round and eventually clinched the title by sweeping
          the North American team, Counter Logic Gaming, in the finals.
        </p>
        <p>
          On July 11, 2016, Lee became the first player to reach 1,000 kills in
          the LCK. His 1,000th kill was on MVP Beyond's Reksai, which he
          achieved on Malzahar.
        </p>
        <p>
          SKT placed third in the 2016 LCK Summer Split, but still qualified for
          the 2016 World Championship through circuit points. The team swept
          through the group stage and advanced towards the playoff round. In the
          semifinals they defeated the ROX Tigers in a close 3–2 series. In the
          finals they defeated Samsung Galaxy in another close 3–2 series,
          winning their third world championship title. Lee was voted as the
          Most Valuable Player of the tournament.

        <h2 class="top-margin center">2017</h2>
        <p>
          Lee renewed his contract with SKT with an "unprecedented offer", which
          was rumored to be over $2.5 million USD.
        </p>
        <p>
          On February 6, 2017, Lee recorded his first live stream on Twitch and
          had a peak viewership of 245,100, setting a record at the time for the
          most views for a single streamer in the history of the site. However,
          this record was broken in early 2018 by another League of Legends
          streamer named Tyler1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lee and his team later won the 2017 LCK Spring Split, clean sweeping
          KT Rolster 3–0 in the finals. This win qualified them for the 2017
          Mid-Season Invitational.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational, SKT topped the group stage with a
          8–2 record. SKT swept Flash Wolves 3–0 in the semifinals and defeated
          G2 Esports 3–1 in the finals to become the first team to win the
          Mid-Season Invitational back to back.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the 2017 World Championship, SKT were still considered by many to
          be strong favorites to lift the cup for a third consecutive time
          despite not winning the LCK Summer Split. After a 5–1 group stage, SKT
          narrowly defeated Misfits and Royal Never Give Up in the quarterfinals
          and semifinals respectively, before facing Samsung Galaxy in a repeat
          of the previous year's final. Despite being favorites going into the
          game, SKT were swept 3–0 by SSG, ending the SKT domination at the
          World Championship. Lee himself was shown to be visibly upset after
          the loss, and had to be consoled by his teammates to shake the Samsung
          Galaxy players' hands post-game. However, this caught the attention of
          many League of Legends fans throughout the world, with much support
          and many tributes being given to the team's legacy and Lee for his
          continued success.
